# php_ajax_searchform
A couple of simple ways of retrieving data from a database with PHP/Mysql and a second one with AJAX

1) Run the Migration to create your Database Schema and the table seed migration right after to populate some sample names
2) Define your Database Credentials in the db_credentials template and rename to db_credentials
3) Run a local server and navigate to index.php
4) Test out the search by entering a name and see your results
5) Should be good.

Master Branch has AJAX included while no-ajax branch as the name suggests, does not.
